        <ul class="quotes">
          <li>
            <span>To Kakashi</span>Those who break the rules are trash, but
            those who abandon their comrades are worse than trash! If I'm going
            to be called trash either way, I'd rather break the rules! And if
            that somehow makes me anything less than a real shinobi, then I'll
            crush all of the so-called "real" shinobi!
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>To Kakashi</span>I'm about to… die… but I'll become your eye…
            and see the future with you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>To Pain and Konan</span>The true power of the Sharingan… this
            is Madara Uchiha's power!" (写輪眼の本当の力が…
            このうちはマダラの力が!, "Sharingan no hontō no chikara ga… kono
            Uchiha Madara no chikara ga!
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Thinking to himself about Sasuke</span>The moment people come
            to know love, they run the risk of carrying hate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>To Naruto and Killer B</span>I'm no one… I don't want to be
            anyone. All I care about is completing the Eye of the Moon Plan.
            This world is completely worthless… there is nothing left in it but
            misery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Thinking to himself</span>You remind me of myself… Naruto…
            yeah… just like when I was young… but, that'll all change with time…
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>To Kakashi</span>Look! There is nothing in my heart! I don't
            even feel pain!! You don't have to feel guilty, Kakashi. This
            windhole was opened by this hell of a world.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>To Madara</span>Now I finally realised that faking one's name
            and letting others do everything for you is different than
            entrusting something to one's comrades. I'm not you. The current me
            is the one who wanted to become Hokage: Obito Uchiha!
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Last words, to Naruto</span>You'll probably have to suffer
            again from now on… but don't change, keep going your way. You told
            me that you never change your words… that's your ninja way. Right?
            Naruto, become Hokage… at all costs.
          </li>
